// You want to go see a movie. To check to showtimes, you to iterate through the 2nd elements of the sub-arrays and make sure the movie time is at least 20 minutes later than the current hour (it's a 20 minute drive to the theater).

// pseudo code
-create an array of shows and movie times
-define a variable for the current time


var movieTimes = [["Amy", 445], ["End of the Tour", 730], ["Magic Mike XXL"] ["Tanjarine", 1200]]
